When making changes, please ensure you are not invading the wrong branches and that you are not 
including unnecessary Node Modules when you Push to this repository.

Recommendations for before you Push to Prod:
    1) Make sure no private data is being pushed.
    2) Make sure no invading-bois tag along.
    3) Make sure your code is correctly formatted.
    4) Forget #3. Why bother?
    5) Ensure that "docs" matches with your changes. If they don't,
        please update them after referring to the CONTRIBUTING.md in
        the respected folder.
