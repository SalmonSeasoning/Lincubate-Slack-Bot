When making changes, please ensure you are not invading the wrong branches and that you are not 
including unnecessary Node Modules when you Push to this repository.

Recommendations for before you Push to Prod:
    1) Make sure no private data is being pushed.
    2) Make sure no invading-bois tag along.
    3) Make sure your code is correctly formatted and that correctly
        documented everything with JSDoc.
    4) Forget #3. Why bother?
    5) Ensure that "docs" matches with your changes. If they don't,
        please update them after referring to the COMPILING.md in
        the respected folder.

Formatting:
    - If you're using VS Code just use ALT-SHIFT-F to correctly format.
    - CRLF Line Endings
    - Indents (equivalent to 4 spaces)
    - Space out curly braces: `{ value1, value2 }`
    - Don't leave spaces in parens: `function myFunc(value1, value2)` vs. `function myFunc( value1, value2 )`
