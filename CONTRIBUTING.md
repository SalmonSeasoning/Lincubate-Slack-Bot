Before committing your changes, make sure it will not disturb the flow of work in this repository.

Make sure tests were done to ensure everything works. If things are known to break because of certain changes,
if they are major, address them before pushing changes. If they are minor and do not explicitly break the bot,
push and fix soon after or ask for another contributor to resolve them.

Keep the formatting consistent. That means if spaces were used instead of tabs, use spaces. If tabs were used
instead of spaces, use tabs. It's recommended to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and
use [ALT] + [CTRL] + [F] to just format the changed documents for you.

Pull before you Push so commits that were probably important aren't sent to the void.

Please... for the love of God, compile the documentation! Don't leave it uncompiled and screw over the joy of
having updated docs!

**DO NOT** spoof your Git commits to look like Linus Torvalds or Bjarne Stroustrup. You're just being a Grade
A dirtbag to all of those people who may actually keep tabs on the commits for one reason or another.

Make sure comments are minimal and understandable. Don't be like Sean and put super indepth comments on literally
every single line of code in a file! It's pointless and messy and actually makes it HARDER to interpret the point
of said code being there!
